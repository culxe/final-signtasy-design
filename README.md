# Final Signtasy: Sign Language Game 

## Overview
Final Signtasy is a 2D pixel art game designed in a top-down perspective, focusing on promoting and educating players about SIBI (Indonesian Sign Language System). The project involved extensive evaluations conducted by multiple lecturers and was showcased at the Computer Engineering Exhibition.

## Game Design
The game design includes the user interface, game maps, and various entities that were meticulously crafted with the goal of making the learning of sign language engaging and accessible.
### User Interface
The user interface was carefully designed to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for players. It incorporates clear visual cues and a user-friendly layout to support gameplay focused on learning sign language.

### Game Maps
The game maps were created with a deep consideration of real-world environments, making it easier for players to relate to the settings and understand the contexts in which certain sign languages might be used. By reflecting familiar surroundings, players can more effectively connect with the material and apply their learning in everyday situations.

### Entities
Entities within the game, including characters and objects, were designed with a focus on realism and relevance to the environments portrayed. This approach ensures that players not only learn sign language but also understand how these signs are used in relation to everyday objects and interactions, further enhancing the educational value of the game.
